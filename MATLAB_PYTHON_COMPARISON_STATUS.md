# MATLAB-Python Comparison Status Update

## Current Status (Post-Rewrite)

After a complete rewrite of main.py to match S01_AnalysisTimestackImages.m workflow, the empty CSV columns issue persists. A diagnostic investigation has been initiated to track down the root cause.

**Latest Changes (Commit 4e332c3):**
- ‚úÖ Added missing `/10` division to Cf1 (matches MATLAB line 242)
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive debug output to track correlation results
- ‚úÖ Added matrix building statistics output
- ‚úÖ Created DIAGNOSIS_EMPTY_COLUMNS.md with root cause analysis

**Next Step:** Run analysis with debug output to identify where NaN values originate in the processing chain.

## Issues Reported and Status

### ‚úÖ 1. Camera Angle Issue - **RESOLVED**
**Report**: "Camera angle keeps changing. It's fixed angle which is set at the start."

**Status**: This was actually working CORRECTLY all along!
- Camera height (z0) is fixed at 27.24m
- Camera angle SHOULD vary per wave because each wave breaks at a different distance
- MATLAB formula: `AngleCam = abs(z0./X1(PosX))` where X1(PosX) varies per wave
- Python correctly implements: `angle = arctan(z0 / distance)` for each breaking wave

**Evidence from output**:
```
Breaking wave distances: min=16.4m, max=20.2m
Camera angles (varying per wave): mean=32.57¬∞, std=1.10¬∞
```

**Note**: I initially "fixed" this incorrectly by making the angle constant, then reverted it (commit 4694801).

### ‚úÖ 2. Tp and Tm Issue - **RESOLVED**
**Report**: "Tp and Tm are the same, which is not possible."

**Status**: FIXED in coastcams/wave_analysis.py (lines 151-175)

**Changes**:
- Tm (mean period): Calculated using zero-crossing method
- Tp (peak period): Calculated using spectral analysis (FFT)
- Removed fallback that set Tp = Tm

**Evidence from output**:
```
Image 1: Tm=8.78s, Tp=14.22s ‚úì
Image 2: Tm=6.96s, Tp=10.67s ‚úì
Image 3: Tm=7.12s, Tp=10.67s ‚úì
```

### ‚úÖ 3. Plotting Orientation - **RESOLVED**
**Report**: "The timestack should have the time on x axis, now it's the opposite"

**Status**: FIXED in coastcams/visualize.py

**Changes**:
- Timestacks are stored as (time √ó space) = (1680, 689)
- For display with time on x-axis, must transpose to (space √ó time)
- Fixed in `plot_timestack()` and `plot_comprehensive_analysis()`
- Now matches MATLAB: `imagesc(Time_TS, 1:size(stack,1), stack)`

**Code**:
```python
# Transpose from (time x space) to (space x time) for correct display
timestack_display = timestack.T
im = ax.imshow(timestack_display, aspect='auto', cmap='viridis', origin='lower')
```

### üîç 4. Empty CSV Columns - **UNDER ACTIVE INVESTIGATION**
**Report**: "A lot of variables are still missing" - WaterDepth, SLA_S, SLA_L, Bathymetry empty

**Status**: Issue persists even after complete rewrite. Root cause analysis in progress.

**User Feedback After Rewrite**:
```
"The results seems worse"
- WaterDepth: EMPTY
- SLA_L: EMPTY
- SLA_S: EMPTY
- BreakpointDepth: EMPTY
- Rows 13-14: Absurd wave heights (191m, 199m)
```

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
The cross-correlation step may not be producing valid Cf1/WLe1 arrays. If Cf1 is empty or all-NaN, it cascades through the entire pipeline:
```
Cf1 (from correlation) ‚Üí WaveCelerity matrix ‚Üí WaterDepth_L ‚Üí SLA_L ‚Üí Bathymetry
```

**Key Issues Identified**:
1. **Missing /10 division** - MATLAB line 242: `Cf1./10` was not implemented (NOW FIXED)
2. **Unknown correlation output** - Need to verify CrossCorrelationAnalyzer produces valid arrays
3. **Timestack format** - May not match what correlation expects
4. **Matrix building** - Need to verify non-NaN values make it to final matrices

**Debug Output Added (Commit 4e332c3)**:
```python
# Track correlation results:
print(f"DEBUG: Cf1 shape: {shape}")
print(f"DEBUG: Cf1 non-NaN values: {count}")
print(f"DEBUG: Cf1 range: [{min}, {max}]")

# Track matrix building:
print(f"WaveCelerity matrix: {shape}")
print(f"  Non-NaN values: {count}/{total}")
print(f"  Value range: [{min}, {max}]")
```

**Next Action**: Run with debug output to identify exact point where NaN values originate.

**Documentation**: See DIAGNOSIS_EMPTY_COLUMNS.md for detailed analysis.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 5. Breakpoint Location Variation - **UNDER INVESTIGATION**
**Report**: "Breakpoint location is too similar at the moment. It should vary a lot more"

**Current behavior**:
```
Image 1: Break location: 17.40m (water depth: 1.10m)
Image 2: Break location: 17.20m (water depth: 1.11m)
Image 3: Break location: 17.60m (water depth: 1.13m)
Image 4: Break location: 17.40m (water depth: 1.06m)
Image 5: Break location: 17.50m (water depth: 1.10m)
Image 6: Break location: 17.20m (water depth: 0.91m)
Image 7: Break location: 17.40m (water depth: 0.78m)
```

**Observations**:
- Break locations: 17.2-17.6m (only 0.4m variation)
- Water depths: 0.78-1.13m (0.35m variation over ~1.5 hours)
- Individual waves within each timestack break over 3-4m range (e.g., 16.4-20.2m)
- Median of individual positions stays constant at ~17.3m

**How it's calculated** (wave_analysis.py:213-217):
```python
median_break_pos = int(np.round(np.nanmedian(PosX)))
break_location = cross_shore_positions[median_break_pos]
```

**Possible explanations**:
1. **Physical (bathymetry-controlled)**: If there's a sandbar or strong bathymetric feature at ~17m, waves will preferentially break there regardless of tidal level
2. **Detection bias**: Radon transform may be biased toward detecting waves in a particular zone
3. **Algorithm difference**: MATLAB may use a different method (not median) to determine representative break location

**Next steps**:
1. Compare with MATLAB's WaveParameters_CoastCams to see how it calculates break location
2. Check if MATLAB uses median, mean, or mode of PosX
3. Review bathymetry profile to see if there's a physical feature at 17m
4. Consider using weighted average based on wave heights instead of median

## Recommendations

1. **Run fresh analysis** with latest code to generate new CSV
2. **Verify CSV columns** are populated (check file timestamp)
3. **Compare breakpoint calculation** with MATLAB - need to review WaveParameters_CoastCams line by line
4. **Check bathymetry profile** - plot cross-shore depth to see if there's a feature at 17m
5. **Consider physical vs algorithmic** - the small variation might be realistic for this beach
