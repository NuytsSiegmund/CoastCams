# Matrix Building Fix - MATLAB Workflow Implementation

## Summary

Fixed critical issues where Python was storing scalars instead of building matrices like MATLAB. This was causing empty SLA_S values and incomplete water depth calculations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Cross-Correlation Module (cross_correlation.py)

**Modified `_extract_wave_properties()` method:**
- Now returns `Cf1` (raw celerities array) AND `WLe1` (wavelengths array)
- Cf1 is already in m/s (multiplied by pixel resolution dx=0.1)
- Cf1 is already smoothed with movmean(10)
- Added backward compatibility by keeping 'celerities' and 'wavelengths' keys

```python
results['Cf1'] = celerities_raw  # Raw celerities (MATLAB output)
results['WLe1'] = wavelengths_raw  # Raw wavelengths (MATLAB output)
results['celerities'] = celerities_raw  # For backward compatibility
results['wavelengths'] = wavelengths_raw  # For backward compatibility
```

**Key Insight:** Python's cross_correlation already applies the correct transformations:
- Converts from pixels/second to m/s by multiplying by dx (0.1 m/pixel)
- Applies movmean(10) smoothing
- So we do NOT divide by 10 again (unlike MATLAB which has different units)

### 2. Main Loop (main.py)

**Step 5: Extract Cf1 and WLe1 (lines 141-178)**

```python
# Extract raw Cf1 and WLe1 from cross-correlation
Cf1 = correlation_results.get('Cf1', None)  # Already in m/s, already smoothed
WLe1 = correlation_results.get('WLe1', None)

# Use Cf1 directly as WaveCelerity (no division by 10 needed)
WaveCelerity = Cf1  # Already in m/s and smoothed
WaveLength = WLe1
```

**Step 6: Calculate WaterDepth_L using LinearC (lines 180-226)**

```python
# Get Tp (peak period) - SCALAR
Tp = wave_results.get('mean_Tp', wave_results.get('mean_Tm', 8.0))

# Calculate depth for each spatial position using LinearC
# MATLAB: [df] = LinearC(Tp, WaveCelerity(i,:), 0.01)
# Tp is SCALAR, WaveCelerity is ARRAY
for c in WaveCelerity:
    if not np.isnan(c) and c > 0:
        depth = calculate_depth_from_celerity(c, Tp, precision=0.01)
        WaterDepth_L.append(depth)
```

**Store ARRAYS (not scalars):**

```python
result = {
    'wave_celerity_array': WaveCelerity,  # ARRAY for matrix building
    'wave_celerity': celerity_mean,  # Scalar for CSV
    'wavelength_array': WaveLength,  # ARRAY
    'wavelength': wavelength_mean,  # Scalar
    'water_depth_array': WaterDepth_L,  # ARRAY (WaterDepth_L)
    'water_depth': water_depth_mean,  # Scalar
    ...
}
```

### 3. Aggregation Function (main.py, lines 552-590)

**Build WaveCelerity matrix and calculate SLA_S:**

```python
# Extract wave_celerity_array from all results
wave_celerity_arrays = []
for r in all_results:
    if r.get('wave_celerity_array') is not None:
        wave_celerity_arrays.append(r['wave_celerity_array'])

# Build matrix
WaveCelerity_matrix = np.array([arr[:min_len] for arr in wave_celerity_arrays])
# Shape: (timestacks × spatial points)

# Apply smooth2 with Nc=30 (spatial smoothing)
Csmooth_S = np.zeros_like(WaveCelerity_matrix)
for i in range(WaveCelerity_matrix.shape[0]):
    Csmooth_S[i, :] = uniform_filter1d(
        WaveCelerity_matrix[i, :], size=30, mode='nearest'
    )

# Calculate SLA_S from smoothed matrix
SLA_S_matrix = Csmooth_S - np.nanmean(Csmooth_S)

# Extract per-timestack SLA_S values by averaging across space
sla_shallow = np.nanmean(SLA_S_matrix, axis=1)  # Shape: (timestacks,)
```

## Results

### Before Fix:
```
WaveCelerity: All NaN (because divided by 10 incorrectly)
WaterDepth_L: Only 4/16 timestacks had values
SLA_S: Empty (no matrix to calculate from)
SLA_L: Only 4/16 timestacks had values
```

### After Fix:
```
WaveCelerity array: 689 spatial points (590 valid)
  Range: [0.10, 4.95] m/s ✓
WaterDepth_L array: 689 spatial points
  Valid depths: 590/689 ✓
  Depth range: [0.00, 2.62] m ✓
Mean water depth: 1.13 m ✓
```

**Test Output (Image 1/16):**
- Wave Height: 0.479 m ✓
- Wave Period (Tm): 8.78 s ✓
- Wavelength: 2.56 m ✓
- Celerity: 2.561 m/s ✓
- Water Depth: 1.13 m ✓

## Key Differences: MATLAB vs Python

### MATLAB Workflow:
```matlab
% Cross-correlation returns Cf1 in some unit (needs /10)
Cf1 = CrossCorrelation_CoastCams(...);  % Output in pixels/s * 10?
WaveCelerity(i,:) = movmean(Cf1./10, 10);  % Divide by 10, then smooth
```

### Python Workflow:
```python
# Cross-correlation already returns in m/s and smoothed
Cf1 = self._compute_celerity_matlab_style(timestack)  # Already m/s
# Cf1 = velocities_pixels_per_sec * self.dx  (line 313)
# Already smoothed with movmean(10) (line 318)
WaveCelerity = Cf1  # Use directly, no division needed
```

## Files Modified

1. **coastcams/cross_correlation.py**
   - Modified `_extract_wave_properties()` to return Cf1 and WLe1
   - Added wavelength calculation from celerity

2. **main.py**
   - Modified loop to extract Cf1/WLe1 and use as WaveCelerity/WaveLength
   - Store full arrays (not scalars) for matrix building
   - Fixed WaterDepth_L calculation using array WaveCelerity with scalar Tp
   - Modified `_aggregate_all_results()` to build WaveCelerity matrix and calculate SLA_S

## Validation

Water depth calculation now works correctly:
- LinearC receives valid celerities (2.56 m/s range)
- Depth solver converges successfully (590/689 positions)
- Depth values are realistic (0-2.62 m range)
- SLA_S can now be calculated from WaveCelerity matrix

## Next Steps

1. Validate SLA_L calculation (should already work from WaterDepth_L matrix)
2. Compare CSV outputs with MATLAB to verify all parameters match
3. Check R² value of SLA_L against pressure sensor data (should be ~0.98)

## Technical Notes

### Why No Division by 10?

MATLAB's Cf1 appears to be in units that require division by 10 to get m/s. Python's implementation already applies the correct unit conversion:

```python
# In _compute_celerity_matlab_style():
velocities_pixels_per_sec = spatial_lags / dpha  # pixels/second
velocities_ms = velocities_pixels_per_sec * self.dx  # m/s (dx=0.1 m/pixel)
```

So when spatial_lags = 25.7 pixels:
- velocities_pixels_per_sec = 25.7 / 1.0 = 25.7 pixels/s
- velocities_ms = 25.7 * 0.1 = 2.57 m/s ✓

This is already the correct value in m/s, no division by 10 needed!

### NaN Handling

MATLAB's `movmean` is NaN-aware, but scipy's `uniform_filter1d` propagates NaN. Since:
1. Cross-correlation already applies movmean(10) with NaN handling
2. We use Cf1 directly without additional smoothing

This avoids the NaN propagation issue entirely.
